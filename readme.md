## Motivation
Malaria is one of the most dangerous diseases leading to thousands of deaths and millions of infected cases annually. 
For years, many studies have been conducted to discover potent antimalarial compounds to treat this disease. Along with 
chemically synthesized compounds, natural products are also demonstrated to have strong antimalarial activities. To investigate 
antimalarial activity in natural products, besides experimental approaches,  computational methods have been developed 
with satisfactory outcomes obtained. In our study, we construct various prediction models to identify antimalarial natural products 
using pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (so-called NPBERT) incorporated with four machine learning 
algorithms, including $k$-Nearest Neighbours ($k$-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Random Forest 
(RF). 

## Results
The results show that SVM models are the best-performed classifiers, followed by the XGB, $k$-NN, and RF models. Additionally, 
comparative analysis between our proposed molecular encoding schemes and existing state-of-the-arts indicates that NPBERT work more 
effectively compared to the others.  Moreover, the employment of Transformers in constructing molecular encoders is not limited to 
this study but can be expanded to address numerous biochemical issues.
